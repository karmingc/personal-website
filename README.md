## Development

### 1. Install VSCODE

_For this project, I used Vscode, so for other IDEs, just make sure they have the right extensions._
<br/>
To enable `Eslint` + `Prettier`, remember to download the extensions in Visual Studio Code.

### 2. Setup

node version: 14.3.0
npm version: 6.14.5

1. Install `node`. [https://nodejs.org/en/].
2. Install `npm`. [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm]
3. To install all the dependencies, in the root folder, hit `npm install` in the terminal.
4. Ready to go -> `npm run dev`.
